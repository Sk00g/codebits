Codebit type is controlled by ctrl + [123]
Chunk 'enter' is ctrl + CHAR
Chunk 'exit' ctrl + CHAR again, ESCAPE, or ctrl + BCKSPC

Chunks are started by typic ctrl + CHAR, cancelled by 'escape' or 'ctrl + BCKSPCE' or 'ctrl + CHAR' again, and submitted by 'shift + ENTER'
    Entry:
    - If nothing is selected and caret is at the end of the sentence, switch to 'chunk entry' mode
    - If nothing is selected and caret is in the middle of a word, make that word the designated chunk data
    - If anything is selected, make selection the designated chunk data
    Exit:
    - If nothing is selected and we are in 'chunk entry' mode, exit mode and generate chunk
    - If nothing is selected and caret is within a chunk, exit that chunk
    - If nothing is selected and caret is anywhere else, do nothing
    - If any part of selection is within a chunk, exit that chunk
    Topic:
    - When a topic is added by mode, remove the word from the actual text
    - If nothing is selected, switch to 'topic entry' mode
    - 'topic entry' mode ends automatically when user presses space
    - If caret is within a word, make that word a topic
    - If a word is selected (trim whitespace), make that word a topic
    - If multiple words are within selection, do nothing

    Mode Logic:
    - Modes are entered per above logic
    - Modes are always exited if the caret moves behind the chunk / topic starting point
    - Selecting an alternate chunk type while in entry mode will swap the current mode
    - Making a selection cancels the mode
